## A selection of site headers and navigation that I have built using React components and TailwindCSS

This is an ongoing project where headers and navigations will be built. As I go components will be abstracted and used in place of the repitition. The end goal is to have as much interactivity with each component as possible.

## Tech

-   This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility first CSS framework. The CSS classes used within the markup is intentional and in line with Tailwind's philosophy
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Library for building user interfaces.
-   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Hosted on their awesome platform

## Suggestions are welcome

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/mauriceLC92/site-navigation/issues) indicating which site header or navigation you would like built.
